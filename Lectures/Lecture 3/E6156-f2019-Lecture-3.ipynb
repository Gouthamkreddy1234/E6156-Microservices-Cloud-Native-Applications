    "- \"Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. Web Services that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by __using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.__ Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.\" \\(Emphasis added\\).(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\n",

    "    - ```check_balance(...)```\n",
    "    \n",

    "    - POST\n",
    "    - DELETE\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "## Another Aside $-$ NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A NoSQL (originally referring to \"non SQL\" or \"non relational\") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the \"NoSQL\" moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages, or sit alongside SQL database in a polyglot persistence architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivations for this approach include: simplicity of design, simpler \"horizontal\" scaling to clusters of machines (which is a problem for relational databases), and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as \"more flexible\" than relational database tables\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic reasons two use a \"Not Only SQL Database:\"\n",
    "- The application does not require RDB functions, which means a reduced function DB can be cheaper, faster, more available, ...\n",

    "    - Updating Data\n",
    "        - UpdateItem – Modifies one or more attributes in an item. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want to modify. You can add new attributes and modify or remove existing attributes. You can also perform conditional updates, so that the update is only successful when a user-defined condition is met. Optionally, you can implement an atomic counter, which increments or decrements a numeric attribute without interfering with other write requests.\n",
    "        - Deleting Data: DeleteItem – Deletes a single item from a table. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want to delete.\n",
    "        - BatchWriteItem – Deletes up to 25 items from one or more tables. This is more efficient than calling DeleteItem multiple times because your application only needs a single network round trip to delete the items. You can also use BatchWriteItem for adding multiple items to one or more tables.\n",

    "    - DescribeStream – Returns information about a stream, such as its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and where your application can begin reading the first few stream records.\n",
    "    - GetShardIterator – Returns a shard iterator, which is a data structure that your application uses to retrieve the records from the stream.\n",
    "    - GetRecords – Retrieves one or more stream records, using a given shard iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transactions: Transactions provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) enabling you to maintain data correctness in your applications more easily.\n",

    "- __Note:__ This is only \"sort of ACID.\" True ACID handles multiple tables and interleaving of reads and writes.\n",
    "    - This is more like \"atomic multiple read\" or \"atomic multiple write.\" Which is useful, and a very common scenario in databases.\n",
    "    - Also, because of the more flexible data model, the application requires fewer tables. Multiple relational tables would often map to a single DynamoDB table."
